# Publishing your documentation

Doctave hosts your documentation for you and integrates easily with CI/CD.

## Is this your first project?

If this is your first project, follow the steps in the [Doctave Dashboard](https://dashboard.doctave.com/). You will be walked through how to upload this project to Doctave.

## Existing projects

Otherwise, [open your project](https://dashboard.doctave.com/sites) in the Doctave dashboard (or [create a new project](https://dashboard.doctave.com/sites/new)), and follow the upload instructions.

## Publishing methods

Doctave supports two publishing methods:

- Drag-and-drop through the browser
- An upload script

The drag-and-drop method is great for testing and getting started, but we recommend using the upload script in production, since it can be used in CI/CD environments to automatically keep your docs up to date.

You can read more about upload methods in our documentation:
